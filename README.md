# An implementation of "The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes"
## Description
The true lazy erastothenes sieve as described by the famous paper of Melissa E. Oâ€™Neill. [Check it](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf)!

Another important source for this study was the Stepanov 's [book on generics](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043).

Nonetheless, the code by O'Neill it's very consistent to the real Erastosthenes sieve demonstrated by the Chapter 3 of Stepanov.
